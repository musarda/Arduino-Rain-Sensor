# What is a Rain Sensor? How does it work?

Rain sensor is a type of sensor used in shallow water levels and rainy conditions. The sensor we will use in this project can measure up to 40 mm water level. In the structure of the rain sensor, there are conductor lines connected parallel to each other. When these lines come into contact with water, it sends an analog signal to the Arduino. Apart from Arduino, it also works with many microcontrollers.
